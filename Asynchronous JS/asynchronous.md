## Asynchronous Programming
1. Javascript excutes the tasks in synchronus way by default. i.e one after other, line by line.
2. if we have 3 functions: func1, func2, func3, and if func1 takes 500 seconds to finish, then func2 and func3 will have to wait for it to complete This slows down the program.
3. To avoid delays, JavaScript supports asynchronous programming, where long-running tasks (like func1) can run in the background. This allows the rest of the code (like func2 and func3) to keep running without waiting.
4. This improves performance and keeps apps responsive, especially for task like fetching data from a server

### some of the inbuilt async functions available in JS.
#### `setTimeout()` & `setInterval()`:
1. these are the asynchoronous functions provided by the JS.
2. they donâ€™t block the flow of code. They schedule a task to run later, while the rest of the code continues running. 

`setTimeOut(callback, delay) & clearTimeOut(id)`: 
1. `setTimeout()` schedules a callback function to run after a specified delay (in milliseconds).
2. It returns a unique ID that can be used to manage or cancel the time.
3. if you want to cancel the scheduled function before it runs, use clearTimeout(id) with the ID returned by setTimeout().
```JS
const id = setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This will not run");
}, 3000);

clearTimeout(id); // cancels the setTimeout
```


`setInterval(callback, delay) & clearInterval(id)`:
1. setInterval() runs the callback function repeatedly at every specified delay (in milliseconds).
2. It also returns a unique ID.
3. To stop the repeated execution, use clearInterval(id) with the ID returned by setInterval().
```JS
const id = setInterval(() => {
  console.log("This runs every 2 seconds");
}, 2000);

clearInterval(id); // Stops the interval (if called later)
```
